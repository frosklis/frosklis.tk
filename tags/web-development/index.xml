      <description>I have moved my blog from a custom based solution to jekyll. What I was using was appengine and before that I had used wordpress.
Wordpress doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you too much control. Of course you can configure it but it is so hard to do, I find PHP a nightmare and Wordpress&amp;rsquo; API difficult to interact with. It was a pain doing plugins. It has one big advange though: it is easy to use for any user.</description>
