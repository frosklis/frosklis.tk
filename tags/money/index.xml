At least I try with, currently, bad results. However I do follow the golden rule of not risking money you really need. I have explored a lot of options in the past such as shares, investment funds or even derivatives such as warrants and CFDs. Overall, I have lost money.
And I have lost it because I really hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken it seriously. It is a full time job and requires a lot of studying&amp;hellip; or a lot of good luck.</description></item></channel></rss>
