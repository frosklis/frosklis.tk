At least I try with, currently, bad results. However I do follow the golden rule of not risking money you really need. I have explored a lot of options in the past such as shares, investment funds or even derivatives such as warrants and CFDs. Overall, I have lost money.</p><p>And I have lost it because I really hadn&rsquo;t taken it seriously. It is a full time job and requires a lot of studying&mldr; or a lot of good luck. Not the case. I just do not have the time nor the will power to dedicate myself to shares tracking.</p><p>So I heard about P2P lending, which is:</p><ol><li>Easy to understand.</li><li>Potentially lucrative.</li></ol><p>The business model is simple:</p><ol><li>Someone needs a loan</li><li>Instead of asking a bank for the money he asks form money in a lending platform (<a href=https://www.bondora.ee/ title=Bondora>Bondora</a>, <a href=https://www.comunitae.es/ title=Comunitae>Comunitae</a>)</li><li>The loan goes through an auction processs, where other people (me!) finance a small part of the loan.</li><li>Once everything is funded, the loan starts to get paid.</li></ol><p>It is simple, just like a bank, but with the power of crowdsourcing. This enables people who need money to have access to it because a bank may not find them suitable and people with money to get a better return than bonds. The risk is of course that people may not pay.</p><p>I have some money in both <a href=https://www.bondora.ee/ title=Bondora>Bondora</a> and <a href=https://www.comunitae.es/ title=Comunitae>Comunitae</a>, with mixed results. <a href=https://www.bondora.ee/ title=Bondora>Bondora</a> allows you to invest from as low as 5€, which is really good for diversification and also gives higher returns. However, I have seen my profitability reduces by a lot of people that just do not pay; when that happens, they are kindly asked to pay before pursuing legal action but - honestly - I do not expect to get any of that money.
The problem is so big that three values of profitability are given: conservative, moderate and optimistic.</p><p>Current conservative expected profitability: 17,75% annually.</p><p>Not bad, but I am starting to like <a href=https://www.comunitae.es/ title=Comunitae>Comunitae</a> better. You have to invest from 50€ on, so it is worse for diversification, but so far a I have experienced less unpaid loans. I am less diversified here, so profitability expectations range from 3% to 19% annually.</p></article></div><footer><div class="copyright tc">2020
