What I was using was <a href=https://cloud.google.com/appengine/ title="Google App Engine">appengine</a> and before that I had used <a href=https://www.wordpress.org/ title=Wordpress>wordpress</a>.</p><p>Wordpress doesn&rsquo;t give you too much control. Of course you can configure it but it is so hard to do, I find PHP a nightmare and Wordpress&rsquo; API difficult to interact with. It was a pain doing plugins. It has one big advange though: it is easy to use for any user. They have done a great job doing that.</p><p>Then I moved to Google&rsquo;s app engine. You can check the blog I have with my girlfriend there, <a href=https://www.kmc2.tk/ title="km c2">kmc2</a>. It is so much nicer to program because you get to use python and you can control absolutely evrything. It is a really powerful tool and simpler to use than <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/ title="Amazon Web Services">aws</a>. Managing users and providing a user interface <em>ala Wordpress</em> was difficult to program but I learned a lot of python, html, css and javascript during the process. Specially the python part is helping my in my job (I do have one!) as a data scientist, as my scripting abilities have improved a lot.</p><p>On to <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/ title=jekyll>jekyll</a>. I am not going to migrate to jekyll my other blog (<a href=https://www.kmc2.tk/ title="km c2">kmc2</a>), at least no any time soon:</p><ul><li>It would be a lot of work.</li><li>I would have to teach my girlfriend how to use it and it is difficult.</li></ul><p>It is difficult but so easy at the same time. Provided you know git and are not affraid of command lines, there is nothing new to learn. Right to my workflow is: I (create a new post)[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/] in a plain text file with a text editor (I use <a href=https://www.sublimetext.com/ title="sublime text">sublime</a>), add it to the repo and commit it. Done.</p><p>There is something goind behind the scene. I created a post-commit hook that takes advantage of the <a href=https://www.parse.com/ title=parse>parse</a> command line tools so that when I commit the site is generated and uploaded to parse.</p><p>My post-commit hook:</p><p>Jekyll is so nice!</p><p>Update 2019: I now use [hugo], which is even better. Using it already for <a href=https://www.kmc2.tk/ title="km c2">kmc2</a> and here too.</p></article></div><footer><div class="copyright tc">2020
