It will be the farthest I’ve ever been from my home country - Spain. Going far away is a big factor on making a trip memorable. This will be some 12,000 km away.</p><p>Indonesia is very different to any other country I have been to, some firsts will happen there . It will be the first time in South East Asia, but this country is so big it touches Oceania. It will also be my first time in the southern hemisphere - it will be winter there, but being so close to the equator we won’t notice. But Indonesia is not only different for me, it is unique on its own.</p><p>With more than 200 million people, it is the biggest muslim country in the world, although religion there is not so strict as in other worlds, it is kind of mixed with ancestral tribal rituals that make it interesting.</p><p>It is the biggest island country. That one is easy, as there are not many island countries in the world (the UK, New Zealand, Madagascar and then small island - countries), but it is BIG, about four times the size of Spain.</p><p>From farthest west to farthest east it is more than 3,000 km, that is comparable to the USA.</p><p>It is the country with most volcanoes on Earth, some of them are active.</p><p>Also, compared to Spain, it is a poor country. Infrastructures are not first world class, no good road network, incredible traffic and strange flight schedules. When I say strange flight schedules I mean there are a lot of local flight companies that do not guarantee that the flight will even take off. This annoyance is making the trip hard to organize. It is easy to get there either to Jakarta or Bali, as there are international connections with big airlines but flying locally - as we will do - is difficult to arrange:</p><p>Flight companies don’t accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Paypal… so you have to book through an agency or have someone there pick up the tickets for you. When you do buy a flight, it is not automatic. You first book it, then you are given the confirmation, a process which takes days. Another thing is visas. You can get visas in the airport, which is convenient, but not in all of them so we may end getting our visas from the embassy (as we may take an internal flight just when we arrive). Interestingly, this is more expensive (almost double, 35€ vs $20).</p><p>Honestly, I enjoy this part of traveling - arrangements. But I wouldn’t go through all the hassle if it weren’t for the good parts of Indonesia:</p><ul><li>Being able to say I was there.</li><li>Go to Bali, which sounds really exotic.</li><li>Seeing the Indian Ocean, which I haven’t seen. Honestly, I don’t know yet if there is Pacific Ocean coast as well, that would make it two oceans I have never seen.</li><li>Incredible scenery - volcanoes, beaches and jungle.</li><li>Strange ancient constructions, with a lot of temples worth a visit.</li><li>See how people live over there.</li></ul><p>We’ll see how it goes :)</p></article></div><footer><div class="copyright tc">2020
