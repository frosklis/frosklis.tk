Despite a lot of hype saying email is broken, I just do not agree. I take pride in going through every email that comes to me. I do the same with the RSS subscriptions.

But there is a catch: I do not read it all. I quickly go through the email and - if it is an automated email - I just press "j" in [gmail] (or [feedly]) or the down arrow in my work mail and go to the next one.

On a typical day (not including spam) I get:
- about 10 emails I do need to read
- about 100 emails I do not need to read
- 120 new posts from my RSS sources

To pin emails I do need to reread I trust in [inbox] by google (so great in the phone!) and outlook in my work laptop. They both have a wonderful functionality: set reminders to your emails.

For the posts, if I don't have time to read through an interesting article, I use [pocket] (I also use it in regular web browsing)

I am happy with the way I handle that, but I can do better. I am trying to unsubscribe from most marketing lists, set apps not to notify me via email and that kind of stuff.

Let's see how it goes.

[feedly]: https://www.feedly.com/  "feedly"
[gmail]: https://mail.google.com/ "Gmail"
[inbox]: https://inbox.google.com/ "Inbox by Gmail"
[pocket]: https://www.getpocket.com "Pocket"
