My girlfriend and I, we have got holidays in August. A little more than three weeks. However, we still haven't booked anything.

The only thing we are really sure of is that we will go somewhere none of us has previously been before.

So we were thinking of going to Africa: a self drive tour across Namibia and Botswana.

Pros:

- It is a once in a lifetime experience.
- The scenery is stunning.

Cons: everything else.

- We should have organised everything at the beginning of the year or earlier.
- Availability is scarce. Specially for those things that are worth the most, such as the Okavango delta or the Victoria falls.
- It is expensive, very expensive.
- It might be dangerous, and not because of humans. Roads are in poor contition and you do have to care about animals.

So the question is to Africa or not to Africa?

The problem with exotic destinations is that you do have to plan well in advance, so we are actually in a hurry to choose a place to go.

Alternatives are:

- India, but where in India? North of India and Nepal? Just the north of India?
- Japan. Totally different, would be far easier to organize.
- Elsewhere.

Fortunately, I know that anywhere we go we will have a good time.
