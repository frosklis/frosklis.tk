title: So I have a blog
date: 2014-10-25

A lot of times have I started some kind of blog. I [have one already](https://www.kmc2.tk) together with my girlfriend where we write about our trips. I used to have one while at university where I talked about the restaurants where we had lunch. I have an account in a lot of services. But a blog as such where I wrote whatever came to my mind and in English, it is a first time.

As this is a personal blog, I will write about whatever I want. I like the idea of [Enrique Dans](https://www.edans.es), that he uses his blog as a place to prepare his classes. It is not that I am a teacher, but I read a lot of stuff and sometimes I find it interesting and like to take notes about it. Having them easily accesible is a very valuable resource for myself. If others like it, even better.

You could say there are tools for that, say [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com) for example, but they are not as fun as coding the blog / website yourself. Eventually the code will be free software, once I feel it is good enough.

By the way, the title of this entry is not original at all. I took it from [Tim Berners Lee's first post in his blog](https://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/38) He invented the hyperlink. Respect.

See you!
