I like my savings to produce more money. At least I try with, currently, bad results. However I do follow the golden rule of not risking money you really need. I have explored a lot of options in the past such as shares, investment funds or even derivatives such as warrants and CFDs. Overall, I have lost money.

And I have lost it because I really hadn't taken it seriously. It is a full time job and requires a lot of studying... or a lot of good luck. Not the case. I just do not have the time nor the will power to dedicate myself to shares tracking.

So I heard about P2P lending, which is:
1. Easy to understand.
2. Potentially lucrative.

The business model is simple:
1. Someone needs a loan
2. Instead of asking a bank for the money he asks form money in a lending platform ([Bondora], [Comunitae])
3. The loan goes through an auction processs, where other people (me!) finance a small part of the loan.
4. Once everything is funded, the loan starts to get paid.

It is simple, just like a bank, but with the power of crowdsourcing. This enables people who need money to have access to it because a bank may not find them suitable and people with money to get a better return than bonds. The risk is of course that people may not pay.

I have some money in both [Bondora] and [Comunitae], with mixed results. [Bondora] allows you to invest from as low as 5€, which is really good for diversification and also gives higher returns. However, I have seen my profitability reduces by a lot of people that just do not pay; when that happens, they are kindly asked to pay before pursuing legal action but - honestly - I do not expect to get any of that money.
The problem is so big that three values of profitability are given: conservative, moderate and optimistic.

Current conservative expected profitability: 17,75% annually.

Not bad, but I am starting to like [Comunitae] better. You have to invest from 50€ on, so it is worse for diversification, but so far a I have experienced less unpaid loans. I am less diversified here, so profitability expectations range from 3% to 19% annually.
