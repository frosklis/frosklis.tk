title: I got myself a Raspberry Pi
date: 2016-03-08

The new Raspberry Pi 3 is out and I got one. I will be using it as a media center with, but I will have other software installed as well. It has a 2TB drive attached to it which I will use to store series, movies and - most importantly - pictures.

Software installed:
- Kodi media center
- Flexget
- Transmission
- Dropbox
- Bittorrent sync

I want to use it also as a backup tool, so when I plug in my hard drive (the one I travel with) the important stuff gets automatically copied to the RPi hard drive. I do have Bittorrent Sync for that, but given the amount of files I have, it is quite slow.
